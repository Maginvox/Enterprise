This is an example file that contains text that helps with the testing of the packaing system.
It could be really useful to write random words. Random words are helpful for testing this system out.
I want to be happy writing these words but am I really? Well to be honest I just do not know. Its a random
stream of events firing in my brain to create these words. Not much thought is being put into them.
Almost half of my brain is shut off yet im still writing words. I dont think. Now somewhere I must be thinking
but I have less of me. It doesn't feel like me. Its just me. If you dont understand what I am saying then thats okay.
Its just an altered state of consiousness. One that does not care about uniqueness or information being passed.
Sometimes I feel lonely. Just kidding I really never do.
